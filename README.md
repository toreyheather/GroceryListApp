# GroceryListApp

This is a console application that allows a user to view a list of available groceries. First, the user is able to add and remove items from this master list. Secondly, the user is able to create a shopping list using these available groceries. The list the user creates then outputs these items sorted by the path a shopper takes through a grocery store (ie: first listed items are produce, followed by bakery, deli, cans/jars, boxes/bags, drinks, frozen, and dairy.) The output is listed in the console and saves as a .txt document.

To use the program simply open in Visual Studio and clinic Run.
